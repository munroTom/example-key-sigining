# Example Key Signing

In order to give a [widget](https://developers.orkestro.io/docs/widget-documentation) access to any of Orkestro's orders a JWT needs to be generated. This token is generated by signing a new JWT with a secret key provided by Orkestro. This repository contains the example code required to generate a token which needs to be inserted into the widget.

## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/orkestro17/example-key-sigining.git
cd example-key-signing
npm install 
<update rsa key, Key Id and App Id in index.js>
npm run start
```

**Note:** for security reasons, we will reject any JWTs that have been generated that have a life span greater than 24 hours.

## FAQ
**Where can I get the rsa key, key id and app id from?**
